This file is a placeholder for the Kominfo Semarang logo. To add the actual logo:

1. Download the official logo from the Kominfo Semarang official website or request it from the organization.
2. Replace this file with the logo image file (preferably in PNG or SVG format with transparent background).
3. Rename the file to `kominfo-semarang-logo.png` or `kominfo-semarang-logo.svg` depending on the format.
4. Make sure the resolution is appropriate for web use (recommended at least 200x200px).

Once added, the logo will be visible in the application's navigation bar and other branded elements.
